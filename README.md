# [Polytron Museum](https://dannycalleri.github.com/polytron/) 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dannycalleri/polytron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dannycalleri/polytron)

Polytron is a side project I worked on during the last year. 
I'd like to imagine it as  a **digital museum** for **PSX 3D models**, but actually, it was just an attempt to render **Resident Evil** 3D models using **JavaScript** and **client-side web technologies**.

This project has been inspired by the great Phoboslab's [Reverse Engineering Wipeout for PSX](http://phoboslab.org/log/2015/04/reverse-engineering-wipeout-psx).


## Development

The first stage of the development was the toughest, because I wanted to find a format not yet decoded in JS that wasn't a total pain to decode.

So I decided to go for .TMD, that was a quite popular format used to store 3D models for the PSX.

The **first attempt** was **beautiful**.
A **total mess**:

But gradually the renders started looking better:

## Tech

The main technologies behind the project are **WebGL/Three.js** for 3D rendering and **React**.
