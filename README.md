# Polytron Museum

Polytron is a side project I worked on during the last year. 
I'd like to imagine as  a **digital museum** for **PSX 3D models**, but actually, it was just an attempt to render **Resident Evil** 3D models using **JavaScript** and **client-side web technologies**.

This project has been inspired by the great Phoboslab's [http://phoboslab.org/log/2015/04/reverse-engineering-wipeout-psx](Reverse Engineering Wipeout for PSX).


## Development

The first stage of the development was the toughest, because I wanted to find a format not yet decoded in JS that wasn't a total pain to decode.

So I decided to go for .TMD, that was a quite popular format used to store 3D models for the PSX.




## Tech

The main technologies behind the project are **WebGL/Three.js** for 3D rendering and **React**.
